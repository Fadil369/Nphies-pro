# Feature Specification: Insurance Claims Analytics, Adjudication, and Rejection Intelligence (Saudi NPHIES)

Summary
An enterprise-grade analytics and adjudication support system for healthcare insurers and providers in Saudi Arabia. It ingests claims data from Excel and PDF sources, normalizes to FHIR R4 (Claim, ClaimResponse, Coverage, ExplanationOfBenefit), enforces HIPAA/NPHIES compliance, and provides bilingual (Arabic-first) dashboards for denial trends, rejection reasons, financial impact, and operational KPIs. Includes eligibility checks, pre-authorization verification, and claim submission readiness validations.

Medical Context
- Clinical Domain: Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) / Payer-Provider Interoperability
- FHIR Resources: Claim, ClaimResponse, Coverage, Patient, Organization, Practitioner, ExplanationOfBenefit (EOB), Encounter, Procedure, Condition
- Medical Standards: ICD-10 diagnosis, CPT/HCPCS procedures, LOINC for lab items (when applicable)
- Saudi Standards: NPHIES payload formats, Saudi National ID/Iqama validation, Arabic clinical/financial terminology

User Personas
- Insurer Analysts (Arabic-first), Medical Coders, Provider Billing Teams
- Auditors/Compliance Officers
- Administrators (System, Security)
- Executives (Finance, Operations)

Core Functional Requirements
1) Data Ingestion and Normalization
   - Import Excel and PDF claim batches (bilingual column headers)
   - Extract tabular and semi-structured data (OCR for scanned PDFs)
   - Normalize to FHIR R4 resources with validation and terminology checks

2) NPHIES and Eligibility Validation
   - Saudi ID/Iqama validation via NPHIESIntegration.validate_saudi_patient_id()
   - Policy coverage and eligibility checks
   - Pre-authorization verification for selected procedures/services

3) Denial and Rejection Intelligence
   - Identify and classify rejections/denials with standardized reason codes
   - Trends by provider, payer, specialty, CPT/ICD, and time
   - Measures: count of rejections, total rejected amount, top denial categories, avoidable denial rate

4) Adjudication Support
   - Rule-based pre-adjudication checks (medical necessity flags, coding consistency)
   - Compliance/benefit rules per payer plan
   - Recommendations to reduce resubmission cycles

5) Bilingual Analytics Dashboards (Arabic RTL default, English toggle)
   - KPI tiles, time-series trends, drill-down tables
   - Export to CSV/PDF (bilingual), auditor bundles with PHI controls
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), glassmorphism UI with BrainSAIT mesh gradients

6) Security, Compliance, and Audit
   - HIPAA/NPHIES enforcement, AES-256 PHI encryption, OAuth2.0 RBAC
   - Full audit logging of PHI access and export events
   - Data retention and secure archival policies

Data Sources (examples)
- Provider claim exports (Excel: xlsx/csv; PDF statements)
- Payer remittance advice (EOB/ERA-like PDFs)
- Master data: payer plans, benefit rules, code dictionaries (ICD-10, CPT, LOINC)
- NPHIES eligibility and claim endpoints

FHIR Mapping Summary
- Claim: header, patient, insurer, provider, items (diagnosis, procedure, unit price, qty, modifiers)
- ClaimResponse: adjudication results, error codes, payment decisions
- Coverage: payor, plan, beneficiary, network, status, period
- EOB: benefit balances, payment amounts, reason codes, line adjudications
- Patient/Organization/Practitioner: identifiers (Saudi ID/Iqama), names (Arabic/English), telecom

Compliance Requirements
- Always wrap sensitive handlers with @hipaa_compliant
- Validate Saudi ID: NPHIESIntegration.validate_saudi_patient_id()
- RBAC roles: insurer_analyst, provider_biller, admin, auditor, patient (limited)
- Log every PHI access to audit-service with user, action, resource, IP, timestamp
- Encrypt PHI at rest and in transit; mask PHI in logs and exports when role-inappropriate

Bilingual Requirements
- Arabic-first UI (RTL), English toggle; IBM Plex Sans Arabic + Inter
- Arabic/English labels for claims, denial categories, amounts, and dates
- Localized numeral formatting and date/time zones

KPIs and Analytics
- Rejection count and amount (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Denial categories (top N) by amount and frequency
- Avoidable denial rate, first-pass acceptance rate
- Resubmission cycle time, days in A/R linked to denials
- Authorization adherence rate, eligibility failure rate
- Provider/payer performance benchmarking

Integrations
- NPHIES: eligibility check, claim pre-validation, claim submission readiness
- Terminology services: ICD-10, CPT, LOINC validation
- Identity: OAuth2.0/OpenID Connect with RBAC scopes
- Storage: Encrypted PostgreSQL for structured data; object storage for source files

Acceptance Criteria
- 95%+ of valid input rows normalize to valid FHIR resources
- NPHIES validation passes for all supported flows; Saudi ID validation enforced
- Arabic/English dashboards render correctly; RTL correctness validated
- Full audit trail for create/read/export of PHI
- Performance: <2.5s for dashboard loads at 1000 concurrent users
- Security: penetration tests pass; PHI encrypted; RBAC enforced
- Compliance: HIPAA/NPHIES checks integrated into CI and runtime

Non-Functional Requirements
- Availability 99.9%+, observability with structured audit logs and metrics
- Scalability for batch ingestion of 100k+ claim lines/day
- Extensibility for new denial reasons, payer rules, and code sets
